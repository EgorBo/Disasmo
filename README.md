Starting with .NET 7.0 RC1 this add-in no longer requires a local build of dotnet/runtime repo.
However, it offers more features with a local one, to obtain a local one please follow these steps:
```ps1
git clone git@github.com:dotnet/runtime.git
cd runtime
build.cmd Clr+Clr.Aot+Libs -c Release -rc Checked

# optional (for crossgen2 + arm64 for hw intrinsics):
build.cmd Clr.CoreLib -c Release -a arm64
```
See [windows-requirements.md](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/docs/workflow/requirements/windows-requirements.md).

## Release notes
See [RELEASE_NOTES.md](RELEASE_NOTES.md)

## Installation
Click on `Extensions\Manage Extensions` menu, select `Online` tab and type `Disasmo` in the "Search" 
text box. Once the add-in is installed you have to close all active instances of VS2022
to let the installer finish its job.

## Features
* Hot-key to quickly see codegen (Alt+Shift+D by default, can be changed in VS's settings)
* Is able to show codegen for ARM64
* Flowgraphs and JitDumps for JIT contributors
* Diffs
* "System.Runtime.Intrinsics quick search" tab
* Inliner's decisions
* 'Run' mode. Is useful for e.g. PGO inspection

## Known Issues
* Only .NET 6.0 and later projects are supported with custom runtime
* .NET 7.0 RC1 (or newer) is needed for non-custom runtime mode
* I only tested it for simple Console Apps, but it should work for libs as well
* Generic methods are not yet supported
* **Resharper** hides Roslyn actions by default (Uncheck "Do not show Visual Studio Light Bulb").
* The lightbulb can be slow on first launch
* AltJIT (e.g. ARM ones) don't emit hw intrinsics (see https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/41518)

## 3rd party dependencies
* [MvvmLight](https://github.com/lbugnion/mvvmlight) (MIT)
* [AvalonEdit](https://github.com/icsharpcode/AvalonEdit) (MIT)
